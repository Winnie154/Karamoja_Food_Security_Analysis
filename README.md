# Karamoja Food Security Analysis Project

This repository contains an analysis assessing and visualizing the food security situation in the Karamoja region of Uganda. The study focuses on the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize).

The dataset is categorized into shapefiles and tables. The shapefiles consist of the boundaries of Uganda Sub Counties and districts, and crop-type maps for maize and sorghum.
The two tables available are Crop yield and population per Sub-County and per District.


## Project Description

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks. Karamoja (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja)

In Karamoja, several NGOs provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yield. Though, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.
Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

To do so, Dalberg Data Insights developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images. The agri-tech team just ran the model for the 2017 crop season.

## Research Objective

As a Data Analyst, the agri-tech team requested me to develop an interactive visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. The analysis will make it possible to develop a new food security monitoring tool to show visibility of the overall state of the region and offer reliable sources of information to guide decisions on matters prioritization of activities by NGOs giving technical support to the regionâ€™s farmers. The visualizations  will  be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.

## Benefits of the Research
The visualization of results provided in this study will provide more reliable and reusable information by NGOs like UNDP in making decisions on resource utilization and an understanding of the overall state of Karamoja region on maize and sorghum productivity.
